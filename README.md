# ScratchTTS

A PHP wrapper of the unofficial Scratch.mit.edu TTS API. Complete with an HTML/JS/CSS UI.

## How to use

If you want to use ScratchTTS, there are 2 ways to do it.

1. Navigate to [the site on 000webhost](http://kanimaki07.000webhostapp.com/projects/ScratchTTS/) to view an online, pre-configured version.

2. If it doesn't work for you, install [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) then clone/download this project. When you're done, unzip the folder, copy the path where you unzipped the folder, and follow these steps:


* Navigate to `localhost`
* Click on "Add a Virtual Host"
* Name the virtual space whatever you want, preferrably "scratchtts".
* Go to where you extracted the folder, copy the path to it's location and paste it into the complete absolute path of the Virtual Host folder.
* Click the "Start the creation of the Virtual Host" button
* When it's done, navigate to the WampServer tray icon, right click, go into "Tools" and click "Restart DNS".
* Wait 5-10 seconds and make sure a command prompt window pops up for a split-second.
* After all that, navigate to whatever you named the virtual host in your browser. E.g. I named mine `scratchtts`.

Keep in mind that no matter which method you use, it requires an internet connection at all times because the PHP sends requests to the unofficial Scratch.mit.edu TTS API itself.

Unfortunately, you can't get it to say swear words due to the filters on the original site. You can use intentional misspellings to try to get past this problem though.
